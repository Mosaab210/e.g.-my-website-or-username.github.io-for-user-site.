    <h1>The Future of Programming</h1>
    <p>As technology evolves, so does the way we code. The future of programming is rapidly shifting towards more intelligent, efficient, and intuitive solutions. From AI-assisted coding to quantum computing, the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible are being pushed every day.</p>

    <h2>1. Artificial Intelligence in Development</h2>
    <p>AI is no longer just an add-on. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT help developers write code faster, find bugs instantly, and even suggest improvements.</p>

    <h2>2. No-Code & Low-Code Platforms</h2>
    <p>These platforms are empowering non-developers to build apps visually. While they won't replace programming, they are shifting the landscape for startups and rapid prototyping.</p>

    <h2>3. Quantum Programming</h2>
    <p>Quantum computing introduces new paradigms of logic and computation. Languages like Q# are being developed to tak
